> *Because your Gallery deserve a gallery app with personality!*

Tulsi is a fork of [LavenderGallery](https://github.com/kaii-lb/LavenderGallery) that dares to be different. While LavenderGallery is already a fantastic gallery app, Tulsi adds that extra bit of flair and functionality that makes your photo browsing experience just *chef's kiss* üëå

## üåü Why Tulsi Exists

Let's be honest‚Äîwe spend hours scrolling through our Gallery, so why not make the experience as delightful as possible? Tulsi was born because:

1. **I'm picky about UI details** - Those rounded corners and floating elements aren't just pretty, they make the app feel more premium
2. **Google Lens should be one tap away** - Why switch apps when you want to know "what's that building?" or "what kind of dog is this?"
3. **Navigation should match how humans think** - Search first, then Gallery, Albums, and Secure stuff tucked away at the end
4. **The devil is in the details** - Subtle animations, proper elevations, and thoughtful spacing make all the difference

All credit for the original codebase goes to the amazing LavenderGallery project. Tulsi just adds a bit of spice to that already delicious recipe! üå∂Ô∏è

### ‚ú® Tulsi's Special Sauce

What makes Tulsi stand out from the original LavenderGallery? Here's the secret recipe:

#### üîç Google Lens Superpowers
* **One-tap visual search** - See a cool landmark? Weird plant? Mysterious gadget? Tap the Lens icon and get answers instantly
* **Multi-layered implementation** - Works reliably across different Android versions and device configurations
* **Fallback mechanisms** - Even if your device configuration is unusual, we've got you covered with 5 different ways to make Lens work

#### üé® UI That Sparks Joy
* **Floating bottom app bar** - With perfectly rounded corners (35% radius), proper elevation, and buttery-smooth animations
* **Thoughtful spacing** - Customized horizontal padding gives your Gallery room to breathe
* **Transparent backgrounds** - In single photo view, with carefully calibrated dimensions (0.95f width, 76.dp height)

#### üß≠ Navigation That Makes Sense
* **Reordered tabs** - Search, Gallery, Albums, Secure - in that order, because that's how most people use a gallery app
* **Consistent three-column grid** - With an optional toggle to switch to date-grouped view
* **Memory for your preferences** - The app remembers your preferred view mode between sessions

#### üîÑ Selection That Actually Works
* **Fixed selection issues** - Glide selection and drag selection work correctly in all view modes
* **Intuitive controls** - Select multiple Gallery with natural gestures

## üîç Google Lens Integration: The Details

Tulsi's Google Lens integration is like having a visual search superpower built right into your gallery app. The implementation is robust with multiple fallback options:

1. **Primary method**: Direct integration with Google app using ACTION_SEND intent
2. **Fallback #1**: Integration with Google Gallery app
3. **Fallback #2**: Generic chooser dialog for maximum compatibility
4. **Fallback #3**: Direct ACTION_VIEW with Google app
5. **Last resort**: Web fallback to lens.google.com

This multi-layered approach ensures that no matter what device or Android version you're using, you'll always be able to identify that strange bug you photographed or find out what mountain that is in the background of your vacation photo.
