# Upstream Changes Summary

## Changes from LavenderPhotos Repository

The original LavenderPhotos repository has made several updates that we attempted to incorporate into our Tulsi fork:

1. **Version Update**
   - Updated version code to 96
   - Updated version name to "v0.9.6-beta"

2. **Fix for Albums with Over 5000 Items**
   - Added a limit to prevent selecting all items in albums with more than 5000 items
   - This addresses an Android limitation where the system can't handle an unlimited number of URIs
   - Modified the `SelectViewTopBarRightButtons` function to disable the "select all" button for large albums

3. **Fix for Custom Tabs Not Loading**
   - Added logging to help debug custom tabs not loading properly
   - Added a log statement in MainActivity.kt to track which tab is being loaded

4. **Added Ability to Include Entire Folders in Custom Albums**
   - Created a new `AlbumPathsDialog` component that allows users to select entire folders to include in albums
   - Added the ability to group paths by parent directory for easier selection
   - Modified the SingleAlbumViewTopBar to show the add button for all albums, not just non-custom ones

## Implementation Challenges

We encountered several challenges when trying to incorporate these changes:

1. **Package Name Differences**
   - The upstream repository uses the package name `com.aks_labs.tulsi`, while our fork uses `com.aks_labs.tulsi`
   - This caused compilation errors when trying to merge changes directly

2. **File Structure Differences**
   - Some files have been moved or renamed in our fork, making direct merging difficult

3. **Custom Features Preservation**
   - We need to ensure our custom features are preserved:
     - Grid view and date-grouped view toggle
     - Selection functionality fixes for grid view mode
     - Google Lens integration
     - Floating bottom app bar customizations
     - Reordered navigation tabs (Search, Photos, Albums, Secure)

## Recommended Approach

Based on our experience, here's the recommended approach for incorporating upstream changes:

1. **Cherry-pick Specific Changes**
   - Instead of merging entire commits, cherry-pick specific changes and adapt them to our package structure
   - Focus on the functional changes rather than trying to merge entire files

2. **Manual Implementation**
   - For some features, it may be easier to manually implement the functionality based on the upstream code
   - This allows us to adapt the code to our package structure and coding style

3. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test each change individually before moving on to the next one
   - This makes it easier to identify and fix issues

## Next Steps

1. Implement the fix for albums with over 5000 items
2. Add the logging for custom tabs not loading
3. Implement the ability to include entire folders in custom albums
4. Test each change thoroughly before committing

By following this approach, we can incorporate the valuable improvements from the upstream repository while maintaining our custom features and package structure.
