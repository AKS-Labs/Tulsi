# Repository Cleanup Summary

## 🎯 **Objective Achieved**
Successfully cleaned up the GitHub repository root directory by organizing documentation and non-essential files into appropriate subdirectories, making the repository root cleaner and more professional-looking.

## 📁 **Files Moved and Organized**

### 🔧 **Build Scripts → `scripts/` Directory**
The following files were moved from root to `scripts/`:

| File | Purpose | New Location |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `build.sh` | Main build script for creating signed APKs | `scripts/build.sh` |
| `fix_packages.ps1` | PowerShell script to fix package names | `scripts/fix_packages.ps1` |
| `push_changes.sh` | Git utility script for pushing changes | `scripts/push_changes.sh` |
| `rewrite_commit.sh` | Git utility for rewriting commit history | `scripts/rewrite_commit.sh` |
| `update_package_names.ps1` | PowerShell script to update package names | `scripts/update_package_names.ps1` |
| `fix_image.py` | Python script to optimize image assets | `scripts/fix_image.py` |

### 🗑️ **Temporary Files Removed**
- `bash.exe.stackdump` - Windows crash dump file (removed)
- `temp/` directory and contents - Temporary development artifacts (removed)
  - `temp/tulsi_fixed.png` - Temporary image output (removed)

### 📚 **Documentation Organization**
- **Already Well-Organized**: All documentation files were already properly organized in the `docs/` directory
- **Enhanced**: Added `scripts/README.md` to document all build scripts and utilities

## ✅ **Files Kept in Root (Essential Only)**

### Core Project Files
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `LICENSE` - Project license file
- `com.aks_labs.tulsi.yml` - F-Droid metadata (must be in root for F-Droid compatibility)

### Build Configuration
- `build.gradle.kts` - Main Gradle build configuration
- `settings.gradle.kts` - Gradle settings
- `gradle.properties` - Gradle properties
- `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` - Gradle wrapper scripts
- `local.properties` - Local development settings

### Essential Directories
- `app/` - Android application source code
- `gradle/` - Gradle wrapper and configuration
- Core project directories (docs, scripts, fastlane, etc.)

## 📝 **Documentation Updates**

### Enhanced Documentation
1. **`docs/INDEX.md`** - Updated repository structure diagram to reflect new scripts directory
2. **`scripts/README.md`** - Created comprehensive documentation for all build scripts including:
   - Purpose and usage of each script
   - Prerequisites and dependencies
   - Security notes and best practices
   - Usage examples and troubleshooting

### Reference Updates
- Updated all internal documentation references to reflect new file locations
- Ensured no broken links or outdated paths in documentation

## 🔧 **Functionality Preservation**

### ✅ **Verified Working**
- **Build Scripts**: All scripts work correctly from their new location in `scripts/`
- **Gradle Build**: No impact on Gradle build process
- **F-Droid Compatibility**: F-Droid metadata remains in correct location
- **Documentation Links**: All internal documentation links updated and working
- **No CI/CD Impact**: No GitHub Actions or automated processes were affected

### 🛡️ **Security Maintained**
- APK signing tools remain in secure location
- No sensitive files exposed or moved inappropriately
- Build script security notes documented

## 📊 **Impact Assessment**

### ✅ **Benefits Achieved**
1. **Professional Appearance**: Repository root now contains only essential project files
2. **Better Organization**: Build scripts logically grouped in dedicated directory
3. **Improved Navigation**: Easier for contributors to find relevant files
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive script documentation added
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing processes continue to work

### 📈 **Repository Metrics**
- **Root Directory Files**: Reduced from ~15 files to ~8 essential files

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved

## 🚀 **Usage After Cleanup**

### Building the Project
```bash
# Build debug APK
./scripts/build.sh

# Build release APK  
./scripts/build.sh release

# Build universal APK
./scripts/build.sh universal
```

### Development Scripts
```powershell
# Fix package names (Windows)
.\scripts\fix_packages.ps1
